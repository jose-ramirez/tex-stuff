    Let ABC be an acute triangle. Let $\Gamma$ be a semicircle with its diameter
    lying in $BC$, and tangent to both $AB$ and $AC$ at $D$ en $E$ respectively.
    Let $F$ and $G$ the intersections of $\Gamma$ with $BC$, $F$ being closer to
    $B$. Also, let $H$ the intersection of the segments $EF$ and $DG$. Then, the
    altitude from $A$ passes through $H$.


    Let the altitude from $A$ intersect $BC$ at $J$. So, suppose $AJ$ does not
    pass through $H$; then it must intersect each segment at different points;
    like $EF$ at $H'$ and $DG$ at $H''$. So, at first we have the following
    chain of equalities:


    $\angle AEH' = \angle AEF = \angle EGF = \angle AH'E$ (since $\angle FEG =
    \angle AJG = 90^{\circ}$, so EH'JG is cyclic), hence $AE = AH'$. Similarly, we
    can conclude that $AD = AH''$, therefore (since $AD = AE$ by construction)
    $AH' = AE = AD = AH''$, which in turn implies, since $H'$ and $H''$ lie on
    the same line, that $H' = H''$, so $AJ$ passes through $H$ as claimed.

	For an inequality seen a long time ago, we have:
	$(xy + xz + xz)\left(\frac{1}{x^2 + y^2} + \frac{1}{y^2 + z^2} +
	\frac{1}{x^2 + z^2}\right) \geq
	(xy + xz + xz)\left(\frac{9}{2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)}\right) =
	\frac{9(xy + xz + xz)}{2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)} \geq \frac{9}{2}$
